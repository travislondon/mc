= Import and Export Types

xtUML Project Implementation Note

== 1 Abstract

User defined types, structured data types and enumeration types need to be
parsed from MASL, imported into BridgePoint and (later) exported as WASL.
This note documents the implementation for this flow.

== 2 Introduction and Background

Adding support for structured and enumeration types has touched all parts
of the import, edit and export flow.  The import parser, serial MASL command
language, MASL to xtUML, BridgePoint editor proper and xtUML to WASL all
are modified to support importing and exporting ASL idiom types.

== 3 Requirements

See <<dr-4>>.

== 4 Work Required

=== 4.1 Export

==== 4.1.1 Export Core Types and Type References

Core type references are exported according to the mapping table below.
This mapping is perform in the templates for `masl -a WASL` rendering
model compiler.

.Type Mapping
[options="header"]
|===
| xtUML   | WASL
| void    | (no type)
| boolean | Boolean
| integer | Base_Integer_Type
| real    | Base_Float_Type
| string  | Base_Text_Type
|===

==== 4.1.2 Export User Defined Types

CDS - pick up HERE

User defined types are exported into the '.typ' file.  Each names (as a
type reference) the ancestor type from which it is derived.

* `masl` rendering and templates shall be updated.

===== 4.1.2.1 Export Constrained User Defined Types

BridgePoint supports ranges on numeric user defined types.  These ranges
must be exported along with the type definition of user defined types.
Ranges are rendered as the last entry on a type definition in the '.typ'
file.

* `x2m` does not currently select and propagate ranges.  Intances of S_RANGE
  need to be selected and propagated as Serial MASL.
* The Serial MASL specification must be updated to carry ranges as a child
  of type.
* `masl` population, rendering and templating updates are required.

==== 4.1.3 Export Instance Handles

For WASL, all classes require a type definition for an instance handle.
The type name is the same as the class name with '_IH' appended.  Note
that `m2x` does not export instance reference data types for MASL.

* For WASL, `masl` needs to change to render the instance handle types for
  all classes in the subsystem.

==== 4.1.4 Export Structured Types

For the ASL idiom in xtUML, BridgePoint structured data types will be
used.  This is in contrast to the MASL idiom which defines the structure
in a textual type editor.

* Serial MASL must be extended to support structures and structure members.
* `x2m` needs to export the structured data types and ordered members in a
  recursive fashion to support nested structures.
* New support will be added to `masl` to support population of structure
  members.  Rendering and templates will be added to emit WASL format
  text into the '.typ' file.

==== 4.1.5 Export Enumerations

BridgePoint enumerations are recognized in both ASL and MASL idiom
modeling.  However, the exported renderings differ.  WASL enumerations are
emitted into the '.typ' file in a columnar format.

* Serial MASL must be extended to support enumerations with enumerators.
* `x2m` needs to export the enumerated data types and ordered enumerators.
* New support will be added to `masl` to support population of enumerations
  and enumerators.  Rendering and templates will be added to emit WASL
  format text into the '.typ' file.

==== 4.2 Import

==== 4.2.1 Import Core Types

Core types are predefined and thus not imported.  However, references to
core types need to be linked to the referencing elements.  This is already
accomplished in the existing flow.  No new work is required.

==== 4.2.2 Import Instance Reference Types

Instance references are not imported _per se_, but imply that all classes
must publish their instance reference data types (instances of 'S_IRDT').

`m2x` already creates S_IRDTs for all imported classes.  No additional
work is required on the import side.

==== 4.2.3 Import User Defined Types

The extant flow supports user defined types.  No work at the top level.

===== 4.2.3.1 Import User Defined Type Constraints

Even though user defined types are already supported, range constraints
are not extracted in the existing flow.

* The MASL import parser must be extended to parse constrained user
  defined types.  This extends from TypeDefinition through the rules to
  the range constraint.
* The Serial MASL specification will be extended to support ranges with
  minimums and maxima.
* `m2x` will be extended to receive range information from the import
  parser and populate S_RANGE instances in BridgePoint.

==== 4.2.4 Import Structured Types

Structured data types need to be parsed in the dumped MASL and converted
to new Serial MASL commands.  The `m2x` processing will populate the OOA
of OOA with S_SDT and S_MBR instances.

* The MASL import parser must be extended to parse structured data types.
  This extends from TypeDefinition through the production rules to the
  structure members.
* The Serial MASL specification will be extended to support structures and
  structure members.
* `m2x` will be extended to receive structure detail and populate the
  xtUML metamodel.

==== 4.2.5 Import Enumerations

Enumeration data types need to be parsed in the dumped MASL and converted
to new Serial MASL commands.  The `m2x` processing will populate the OOA
of OOA with S_EDT and S_ENUM instances.

* The MASL import parser must be extended to parse enumeration data types.
  This extends from TypeDefinition through the production rules to the
  enumerators.
* The Serial MASL specification will be extended to support enumerations
  and enumerators.
* `m2x` will be extended to receive enumeration detail and populate the
  xtUML metamodel.

== 5 Implementation Comments

=== 5.1 Dialect (Architecture) Switch

The `m2x` translator converts input MASL into xtUML.  With the requirement
to import ASL idiom types differently from MASL idiom types, a new switch
is required on the `m2x` command line.

ooapopulation::populate( element, value[] )
ooapopulation::transformType( name, visibility, definition )
ooapopulation::Package_newDatatype( package, name, definition )

Strategy:
1) Upon 'type', create S_DT and S_UDT.
2) Upon 'enumeration' or 'structure', migrate the S_DT from S_UDT to S_EDT or S_SDT.

ooapopulation::Datatype_migrateUDTToEDT( s_dt )
ooapopulation::Datatype_migrateUDTToSDT( s_dt )
ooapopulation::Datatype_EDTaddENUM( s_dt, name, expression )

need current_mbr and current_structure

x2m

Formalize R3751 between 'type' and subs.  Use 'name' as identifier.
Add 'enumeration', 'enumerator', 'structure' and 'member' as subtypes of unmarkable.
Receive 'populate' commands for the above.

Need to omit "sequence of" on maslin.  Dunno whether in the parser or later.

Need to convert "instance of" on maslin to inst_ref<>.  Hmm, may run into trouble with OOA distinction of instance and set.

wasldiff:

  * ignore Cannot_Happen/Ignore on lines with Non_Existent.

WASL files have Cannot_Happen and Ignore coming out of Non_Existent.  However, the MASL dumper always dumps Cannot_Happen for notransistions out of Non_Existent.

Fix TAGS by awking array mark and singleton mark.  Need to respond to these marks on the generated end.
  * multiplicity_array

 commas in descriptions need to be subbed with __

Do not generate state activity definitions for unreachable states.  Output a message when this is detected.
But notice a TODO in genfile_render to consider a switch.  Caledonia may like to disable the optimization.
