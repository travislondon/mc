= Metamodel Changes for WASL

xtUML Project Implementation Note

== 1 Abstract

This note documents adding additional attributes to classes in the xtUML
metamodel (OOA of OOA) to support ASL, the action language originally
supported in iUML.

== 2 Introduction and Background

ASL is the default action language in iUML.  ASL is being supported in
BridgePoint.  ASL action language makes direct reference to some iUML
metamodel artifacts that do not presently exist in the OOA of OOA.

== 3 Requirements

=== 3.1 Identify and Enumerate Missing Elements

ASL uses numbers on various action bodies.  Domain funtions, class operations
and terminator services have numbers associated with them.  These numbers are
named in the invocations of the routines and required in the WASL
transformations.

WASL understands both a name and key letters for domains.

Enumerate the necessary new attributes and place them on appropriate
classes in the OOA of OOA.

==== 3.1.1 Establish Default Values and Ranges

For each element identified in <<3.1 Identify and Enumerate Missing
Elements>>, outline the default value and range.

=== 3.2 Add Elements to Model Compiler OOA of OOA (`mcooa`)

The attributes identified in <<3.1 Identify and Enumerate Missing Elements>>
shall be added to the model compiler metamodel, `mcooa`.

=== 3.3 Add Elements to BridgePoint OOA of OOA

The attributes identified in <<3.1 Identify and Enumerate Missing Elements>>
shall be added to the BridgePoint OOA of OOA and in such a way as to maintain
backwards compatibility.

=== 3.4 Support Editing New Element Values

The attributes identified in <<3.1 Identify and Enumerate Missing Elements>>
must be editable by the user.  A simple cell editor in the Properties view
is sufficient for this requirement.

== 4 Work Required

=== 4.1 Identify and Enumerate Missing Elements

* Function.Numb:INTEGER
* Operation.Numb:INTEGER
* Terminator Service.Numb:INTEGER
* Executable Property.Numb:INTEGER
* Required Operation.Numb:INTEGER
* Port.Key_Lett:STRING
* Component.Key_Lett:STRING

==== 4.1.1 Establish Default Values and Ranges

In the existing OOA of OOA, State Machine Event has a number (`Numb`)
attribute.  It defaults to 1 for the first event added.  New events are
automatically assigned an incremented number 1 higher than the highest
numbered event in the state machine.  Uniqueness among event numbers is
assured unless overridden by the user, which is allowed.  The range of
values for event numbers is from 1 to 9999.

Function.Numb, Operation.Numb, Executable Property.Numb and Terminator
Service.Numb will follow the behavior pattern established for State
Machine Events within their respective scopes (Domain/Component, Class,
Port and Terminator respectively).

Component.Key_Lett will be initialized with the name of the Component
and will have the same legal value restrictions as other 'Key_Lett'
attributes in the OOA of OOA (e.g. no blanks).

=== 4.2 Add Elements to Model Compiler OOA of OOA (`mcooa`)

* The `ooaofooa` subsystem is edited to add the attributes with appropriate
  types and ranges (as markings in the Descrip field).
* The model compiler schema is updated to reflect the changes.

=== 4.3 Add Elements to BridgePoint OOA of OOA

The OOA of OOA is edited to add the new attributes to the enumerated
classes.  The initialization operation(s) for the classes are updated
to establish defaults.

The MC-Java schema is updated to reflect the changes.

=== 4.4 Support Editing New Element Values

Cell editors are generated for the new attributes based on the presence
of marks in the 'Descrip' fields of each new attribute.  Again, the lead
was followed of other similar attributes in the OOA of OOA.

== 5 Implementation Comments

=== 5.1 Implementation Sequencing

The file changes needed to deliver full functionality of this work span
multiple independent modules.  I chose to take baby steps in a way to
avoid having to debug everything at once.

Steps:

. Add the new attributes to `bp.core:ooaofooa` (without markings).
. Build and fix fallout in upgrade code.  (Some upgrade code directly
  invoked the Component constructor.  Also, new attributes need to be
  special cased.  Instead, I checked length of raw input on all integers.)
. server build
. Update `ooa_schema.sql`.
. server build
. Update mcooa by adding the attributes.
. Update `xtumlmc_schema.sql`.
. server build
. Update maslin to populate operation numbers and domain key letters.
. Update maslout to use MM operation numbers and domain key letters
  rather than markings.
. server build
. Add markings to the attributes to generate cell editors.
. Update the initialization and modification operations on the attributes.
. server build

== 6 Unit Test

. `round_trip` testing of the MASL test suite shall continue to pass.
. `round_trip` importing of SWATS models will execute successfully.
. The 'DomainB' SWATS test model will generate a clean WACA build.
