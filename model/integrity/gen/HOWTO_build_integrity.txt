First, generate ooa.txt by running integrity.arc in the mcooa project.
Paste ooa.txt into the check_referential_integrity in the integrity model.

For Linux and Mac there is a makefile in the src folder that you can use.

For Windows, compile on Linux using:
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -Wno-pointer-to-int-cast *.c -static -o integrity.exe
