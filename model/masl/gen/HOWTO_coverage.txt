How to add coverage to masl.

This only needs to be done when the masl semantic model changes
or when coverage.arc is enhanced.

1. Rename coverage.ark to coverage.arc.
2. Build masl.
3. Re-rename coverage.arc to coverage.ark.
4. Copy the contents of coverage.txt into maslpopulation::population::coverage.
5. Build masl.
